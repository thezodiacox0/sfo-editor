# SFO Save Editor

SFO Editor is a Python script for Terminal/CMD that adds a GUI to automate the use of commands from the SFO tool written in C by [Hippie68](https://github.com/hippie68/sfo) for PlayStation 4. It also includes some extra features.

## Notes

- The first time you run the script, it will ask you to choose a language. This will only happen once, and the selected language will be saved as the default.
- Inside the Settings menu of the script, you can change the default language, create a backup before modifying, and more.
- This script is intended for editing the `PARAM.SFO` file of PS4 save data.
- If you want to manually change the default language, you need to edit the `saves_language` parameter in `translations.json`, which stores the translations.
- To see emojis correctly, you need a terminal compatible with UTF-8 Unicode.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3 & pip
- Requests
- Colorama

### Install the dependencies

[Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

> [!TIP]  
> When running the installer on Windows, select all options to ensure that pip is installed correctly.

Python for Linux

```bash
sudo apt install python3 && sudo apt install pip -y
```

Once the above is installed, run:

### Colorama & Requests

```bash
pip install colorama && pip install requests
```

## Features

- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux).
- Modify SFO parameters individually or both at once.
- Create a backup of `PARAM.SFO` before modifying it.
- Load a predefined JSON configuration to automate SFO modifications.
- FAQ and Troubleshooting section included.
- Available for x86 and x64.
- Online database to download JSON configurations from GitHub.
- Multi-language support (Spanish & English).
- Emoji support visible from PS4/PS5.

## JSON Configuration

To create a JSON configuration to load or share later, follow these steps:

1. Copy an example file and rename it, for example, `thezodiacox.json`.

2. Modify each of its parameters and add more if desired; these will be shown as informational fields in the preview:

  - **ConfigName**: This parameter will not be shown in the preview but will appear in the configurations list (e.g., SFO Example).

  - **MainTitle**: This parameter will change the title shown in the save on the PS4/PS5 (e.g., SaveData Example).

  - **SubTitle**: This parameter will display the description, i.e., the "Details" text on the PS4/PS5 (e.g., Savedata Example Extended).

  - **Version**: This parameter is purely informational but serves to indicate that changes have been made (e.g., 1.2b).

  - **Notes**: This parameter is informational and is used to add notes about the configuration.

3. Once all parameters have been modified, save the file in the `config` folder. The next time the script runs, it will detect the new configuration.

## PARAM.SFO Backup

When a backup is created, it is renamed to make it easily identifiable:

BACKUP-(Method)(TITLE_ID Numbers)-(Random Identifier)(File Count).sfo


- **Method**: Indicates whether parameters were modified individually or using automation (SFO or CONFIG).

- **TITLE_ID Numbers**: For example, GTA V Europe CUSA is `CUSA00411`.

- **Random Identifier**: A 4-digit number randomly generated between 1000 and 9999 used to identify the copy.

- **File Count**: A 2-digit number starting from 00, representing how many times a backup has been made with the same TITLE_ID and method.

**Example Individual**: `BACKUP-SFO00411-541300.sfo`  
**Example Load Configuration**: `BACKUP-CONFIG00411-828500.sfo`

## Online Database from GitHub

SFO Editor can download JSON configurations from a GitHub repository and save them to the existing configurations folder. These are stored as Packs, and you can choose to download some or all of them.
